   <h3><em class="subtopics">STEPS</em></h3>
   <ol>
     <li>Wash the Afang leaves thoroughly and blend or pound them until finely chopped. Set aside.
     </li>
     <li>Prepare the assorted meats by cutting them into bite-sized pieces. Rinse with water, and then season with salt, onions, and any other preferred spices. Cook the meat until tender in a pot with water or meat broth. You can use a pressure cooker to reduce cooking time.
     </li>
     <li>If using stockfish, soak it in water for a few hours or overnight, depending on the toughness. Once it softens, cut it into smaller pieces and add it to the pot of cooked meat. Cook until both the meat and stockfish are fully tender.
     </li>
     <li>In a separate pot, heat the palm oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
     </li>
     <li>Add the blended crayfish to the pot and stir for a few minutes. Then, add the smoked fish and periwinkle (if using) and continue stirring.
     </li>
     <li>Pour the cooked meat, stockfish, and meat broth into the pot of sautéed onions, crayfish, and fish. Stir everything together and allow it to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
     </li>
     <li>Add the chopped Afang leaves to the pot and stir well. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it cook for an additional 5-7 minutes. The leaves will wilt and soften during this time.</li>
     <li>Season the soup with salt, pepper, and seasoning cubes according to your taste preferences. If desired, you can also add some grounded ogiri (a traditional Nigerian condiment made from fermented oilseeds).
     </li>
     <li>Let the soup simmer for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring that the flavors are well incorporated. At this point, you can adjust the consistency by adding more water or broth if necessary.
     </li>
     <li>Turn off the heat and serve the Afang soup hot with your choice of swallow (e.g., fufu, pounded yam, or garri).
     </li>
   </ol>
