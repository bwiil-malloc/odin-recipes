         <h3 class="subtopics">STEPS</h3>
     
         <Strong>Preparing the beans</Strong>
     
         <ol>
           <li>. Rinse the dry beans under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Soak the beans in water overnight or for at least 6 hours. This step helps to soften the beans and reduce the cooking time.
           </li>
       <li>After soaking, drain the beans and rinse them again.
       </li>
       <li>In a large pot, add the beans and cover them with water. The water level should be about 2 inches above the beans.
       </li>
       <li>Bring the pot to a boil and let it boil for 5 minutes. Then, reduce the heat to a simmer.
       </li>
       <li>Cover the pot partially with a lid and let the beans cook for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until they are tender. Check the beans occasionally and add more water if necessary to prevent them from drying out.
       </li>
       <li>Once the beans are tender, add salt to taste and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Then, remove from heat and set aside.
       </li>
       
     </ol>
       <p>
       <strong>Preparing the dodo(plantain)</strong>
       </p>
       
       <ol>
         <li>Peel the plantains and cut them into diagonal slices about 1/2 inch thick.
         </li>
         <li>Heat some cooking oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium heat.
         </li>
         <li>When the oil is hot, add the plantain slices in a single layer and fry them until they turn golden brown on both sides. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes per side.
         </li>
         <li>Once the plantains are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Set aside.
         </li>
       </ol>
       
       <p>
         <strong>Preparing the Beans and Dodo Stew</strong>
       </p>
       
       <ol>
         <li>In a separate pan, heat some cooking oil over medium heat.
         </li>
         <li>Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the pan and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.
         </li>
         <li>Add the diced red bell pepper and cook for a few more minutes until it softens.
         </li>
         <li>Stir in the thyme, paprika, curry powder, and bouillon powder or cube (if using). Mix well to combine the flavors.
         </li>
         <li>Add the cooked beans (along with any remaining liquid) to the pan with the onion and pepper mixture. Stir everything together.
         </li>
         <li>Allow the stew to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together. If the stew becomes too thick, you can add a little water to adjust the consistency.
         </li>
         <li>Taste the stew and add more salt or seasoning if needed.
         </li>
         <li>Serve the beans and dodo stew hot, accompanied by the fried plantains.
         </li>
       </ol>
